# Lets Rethink Search for the AI Era

Search is broken. For decades, we've been forced to think in keywords instead of concepts. We've learned to contort our thoughts into search-engine friendly phrases, losing nuance and context along the way.

## Our Mission

At Sokratis, we're removing this artificial abstraction layer between human thought and information discovery. We believe you should be able to:

- **Ask Real Questions**: Express your thoughts naturally, just as you would to a knowledgeable friend
- **Get Contextual Understanding**: Receive results that truly understand the concepts behind your question
- **Trust Your Results**: Make informed decisions with our reputation-based reliability scoring

## How We're Different

Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords, Sokratis:

- 🧠 **Understands Context**: Our AI comprehends the deeper meaning behind your questions
- 📚 **Reads for You**: Analyzes webpages to find truly relevant information, not just keyword matches
- 🎯 **Points to Sources**: Provides direct references to reliable information, no AI hallucinations
- 💡 **Suggests Related Concepts**: Helps you explore connected ideas and deepen your understanding
